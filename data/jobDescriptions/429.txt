As a part of our team, you’ll rely on your prior experience to provide administrative support to our attorneys through preparation of legal documents and correspondences, such as motions and pleadings.  Experience using an electronic case management system - while not required - will help while managing attorney calendars, scheduling and coordinating examination(s) for defense experts, and communicating with clients regarding relevant aspects of the case.  Among other things, you’ll spend time maintaining files, answering phone calls, along with other assigned administrative duties.
